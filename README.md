# aur-pacakges

This repo builds several AUR packages and deploys them to my personal arch repository.

It builds on every push and on a schedule to make sure packages are up-to-date.

## Packages

- FreeCAD (and it's AUR dependencies)
- Google Chrome
- Zrepl
- obs-vl4l2sink
- wlrobs-hg
- xlayoutdisplay
